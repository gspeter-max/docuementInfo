    Resolves raw entity names into a single canonical name per real-world entity.

    collapses those variants into one agreed-upon name:

    Stage 1 — Exact normalization:
        Groups names that are identical after lowercasing/stripping spaces.
        Picks the shortest variant as the canonical name.
        Example: ["Apple Inc", "apple inc"] -> "Apple Inc" (shortest)

    Stage 2 — Fuzzy merge:
        Detects near-duplicate names (e.g. "Jhon" vs "John") using fuzzy
        matching. Clear matches are merged automatically; ambiguous pairs are
        sent to the LLM for a final yes/no decision.
